A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. There might a lot of resources out in the web to determine if a string is palindrome using Javasript, C#, Java and other programming languages. I took a step-back and thought of sharing the code in Apex to help.

Single Word Palindrome:
<ul>
<li>Anna</li>
<li>Civic</li>
<li>Kayak</li>
<li>Level</li>
<li>Madam</li>
</ul>

Multiple Word Palindrome:
<ul>
<li>Don't nod.</li>
<li>I did, did I?</li>
<li>My gym</li>
<li>Red rum, sir, is murder</li>
<li>Step on no pets</li>
</ul>
